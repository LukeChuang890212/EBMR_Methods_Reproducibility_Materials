# EBMR_Methods_Reproducibility_Materials
This repository is the reproducibility materials for "Ensemble-Based Multiply Robust Methods for Missing Not at Random Data with Model Misspecification". There are three folders: EBMRalgorithm, Simulation_Studies and Mental_Health_Data_Application. Below introduces the details of these three folders.

**EBMRalgorithm**

This folder is a r package that can be loaded into R by the syntax: "devtools::install_github("LukeChuang890212/EBMR_Methods_Reproducibility_Materials/EBMRalgorithm")". Inside EBMRalgorithm/R, there are five essential R files: EBMRAlgorithm.r, WangShaoKim2014.r, Methods.r, Preprocessor.r and Fool_proofing.r. In EBMRAlgorithm.r,
